# Refactoring project

Clone this repo [refactoringtrainingproject](https://github.com/MichielNoback/refactoringtrainingproject).
Continue the refactoring process according to the instructions in the Readme.md of that repo. The code base is more or less functional
as it is, so it may be a good idea to start by thinking about top-level JUnit tests to guarantee functionality is not broken, and then
start your work on the main class, `GffQuery`. To begin with a blank slate, check out tag 0.2 of branch master (commit `19a08f4`)
